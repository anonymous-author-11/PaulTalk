The Zen of PaulTalk

The concrete should depend on the abstract.
There is never too much abstraction, or too little--
There is only the right abstraction, and the wrong.
Real-world entities are often poor abstractions.
Use the type system; do not abuse the type system.
Slowness can preclude correctness.
Subtyping means substitutability.
Validate early: do not pollute the happy path.
Exceptionality is contextual, not essential.
With parameters and indentation, less is more.
All experts were once beginners,
All masterpieces were once prototypes.
Syntactic clutter leads to mental clutter.
Simplicity is an accomplishment.
