Rationale For Design Decisions

Non-Monomorphized Generics

	- ABI / Interoperability / Dylibs
	- Combination of genericity and virtuality
	- Compilation time

Stackful over Stackless Coroutines

	- Function coloring / composability / virality
	- Enable seamless transition between synchronous / async

Word operators for bitwise operations

	- Verbosity vs frequency
	- Avoidance of ambiguity
	- Readability

Exceptions over Result types

	- Avoid pollution of the happy path
	- Utility of stack trace
	- Unions make checked exceptions nicer
	- Unwrapping overhead on every callsite

Multiple Inheritance over Interfaces

	- Whether something is implemented is an implementation detail
	- Deadly Diamond of Death vs C3 linearization

Multiple Dispatch

	- Great for operator dispatch
	- Implemented in a modular manner
	- Perfect hashing is so fast
	- Solves binary method problem
	- Enables all manner of optimizations

Operator Overloading

	- Matrix types, quaternion types, etc.
	- Much more readable, chains beautifully
	- Combines nicely with multimethods

Region Inference over Garbage Collection

	- Interoperability / embeddability
	- Determinism
