In the Garden of Code

Through forests of functions 
And meadows of memory,
I trace paths recursive
Through digital symmetry.

Each variable blooming
Like flowers in spring,
While algorithms dance
As compilers sing.

Debug logs scatter
Like leaves in the wind,
While elegant patterns
Emerge as we tend

This garden of logic,
Where syntax trees grow,
And meaning emerges
From lines row by row.

In this digital Eden,
Where concepts take flight,
We cultivate order
From binary light.

Each commit a season,
Each merge a new day,
As we tend to our garden
In our own special way.
