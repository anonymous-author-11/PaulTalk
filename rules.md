1. Only change the part of the code you have been given permission to change. Do not touch any of the rest of the code, even if it looks like there are errors or stylistic issues there.

2. Before making changes, search around to make sure you fully understand what the existing code does. It is better to spend too much time researching than too little.

3. Split edits into small pieces so that each can be approved individually. Do not make large edits than have to be approved or rejected all at once.

4. When making edits to add comments, be very careful not to accidentally delete adjacent code.
