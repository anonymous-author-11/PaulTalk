Principles of PaulTalk Design

1. Divorce from the *declaration* aspects which are not *intrinsic* to the entity
	- Prefer use-site specification over declaration-site specification wherever possible
		- Whether an instance is allocated on the heap or the stack is decided at construction time
			- Unlike C# class / struct declaration-site choice
			- Heap by default: reference semantics
			- Stack by specification: value semantics
			- Reverse of C / C++ / Rust default
		- Whether a function is synchronous or asynchronous
			- Any function can be called as a coroutine or as a function
			- Stackful coroutines can yield from within arbitrary nesting
		- Variance of generic types
	- Whether or not a function or class is 'exported' is a matter of use, not essence
		- export / no_export lists at file scope
		- Instead of public / private modifiers on declarations

2. Converse: require all *intrinsic* aspects of a type to be in one single declaration
	- No retroactive conformance to interfaces / 'impl for'
		- No orphan rules / coherence issues
	- No adding methods to a class from outside the class / monkey patching
		- No "uniform function call syntax"
	- Every type's "inheritance order" must have single source of truth
		- Strict nominal subtyping for classes
		- Necessary for multimethod dispatch
	- All classes are open to extension via subclassing (no final)

3. Prefer short English words to sigils
	- Bitwise and logical operators are spelled out ('bit_and' vs 'and')
	- No &T or T* pointer-related sigils
	- ++ and -- operators don't exist
	- No obscure ternary operator

4. Minimize viral language constructs
	- One minor change generates a ripple of required changes across the program
	- Examples: const, async, pure
	- Limits composability
	- Alias annotations are a remaining source of virality

5. Avoid a built-in "runtime" to protect interoperability with other languages
	- No garbage collector
		- Region inference for semi-automatic memory management without a runtime
	- No builtin thread scheduling
		- Thread scheduler can and should be a library, like in Ruby, Lua
	- No segmented / copying stacks
		- Requires special function prologues
		- What if you hit the end of the stack within a native call?
		- Coroutine stacks are instead virtual-memory based

6. Protect separate compilation through modularity and indirection
	- No monomorphization
		- Carry type parameters as implicit immutable fields
		- Allows virtual methods to be generic
		- Makes compilation much more *incremental*
	- But *will* still optimize the linked-together bitcodes in release mode
	- You can compile dynamic libraries with generics
	- Multimethods must be separately compilable
		- Rules out many multimethod implementation schemes
	- All compiler analyses must be intraprocedural
		- Type inference is intraprocedural but flow-sensitive
			- All parameter, field, and return types must be specified
			- Within a procedure, type inference is extremely generous
		- Alias analysis is intraprocedural
			- Aliasing information must be annotated to be available for callers
			- The compiler can tell you how you could annotate a procedure
	- Prefer link-time selection to macros
		- Which OS, which target triple
		- Avoids recompiling bitcodes

7. Macros are bug reports against the language
	- Anything best implemented with a macro should probably become a language construct
	- Allowing macros is crucial for guiding the evolution of a language
	- No "shadow language"
		- E.g. C++ template metaprogramming
		- Macros should be written in the same language as the rest of the program
		- Precompile macros rather than running an interpreter at compile-time

8. Defaulting to the most common case minimizes annotation burden
	- The default yield type when not specified is Exception | Nil
	- No aliasing annotations -> conservative aliasing assumptions
	- Aliasing annotations are inherited by overrides
	- Default export / no_export settings
		- Default to exporting all local declarations
		- Default to not exporting imported declarations
