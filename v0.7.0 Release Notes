v0.7.0 Release Notes

- Faster compilation times
- Commit memory on-demand via page fault handler
- Make it illegal to assign to 'self'
- Correctly handle new scope blocks in typeflow
- Increase determinism in the compiler-- deterministic node ID's
- Write runtime utilities for region system
	- Can be found in data_files/region_runtime.ll
	- Will eventually be lowered to
- Prioritize current-file classes and functions when multiply defined
- Implement basic liveness analysis
	- Inserted operations are simply removed during lowering
- Add more concise alias annotations
	- Should significantly reduce verbosity
	- a holds (b, c, d)
	- a == b == c
	- (a, b, c) holds d
- Improved points-to analysis
	- Exclude trivial value types from the graphs in apply_constraints
	- Better error messages for points-to graph analysis
	- Only print points-to graphs on error
	- Add conservative aliasing (all_alias) by default
		- For .annotated_facts and .constraints
	- Reform tuple and buffer points-to-facts
		- Tuple: add pseudo-fields .0, .1, etc.
		- Buffer 
			- holds rather than == constraints
			- No more .elems_reg
	- Integrate no_alias and all_alias annotations
		- If all_alias, skip graph compatibility check
			- Incorporate in override check as well
		- Must wait until typeflow to determine if no annotation means all_alias
			- B/c could inherit annotations from overrides
	- Infer all_alias annotation in general case
		- If the constraint set is empty AND no_alias is NOT specified
	- Mark .init methods as no_alias by default
	- Propagate all_alias on function / method call
		- Upon any call to a non-annotated fn, mark the calling context as all_alias
		- Proceed as if there had been no aliasing
		- At end of context, merge all the nodes into one
