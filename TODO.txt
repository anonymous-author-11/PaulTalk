TODO:

- Need to take instantiatedTypeFields out of fields() and change offsets accordingly
- 

- Pass types from method context to new
- Think about how actually to handle union type parameters
- We need a mapping between types available to init() and type fields
- Implement type parameter deduction from init()
- Make sure that type bounds are applied generally
- Where clauses for method type parameters
- Figure out signature compatibility of overrides of generic parameters
- Store type parameters as fields and access via vtable
	- Organize type parameter overloads for each class [check!]
	- Produce flat list of type parameters for each instance
		- At time of creation
		- Need to borrow type parameters from context
		- Both class and method context
- Figure out a way to get methods into builtin vtables
	- Define intrinsics for operations on boxed interfaces
	- Move Object and certain blessed classes to box interface
	- Not sure it is actually necessary to have a special boxed interface for certain classes
- Shift array and range literals to new generics
	- Will need to do buffer optimization first for array
	- And to do buffer optimization we need stored type parameters
- Add file name to error messages
- Make nil its own ancestor
- Make intrinsics better
- Buffer! Buffer! Buffer!
- Think generally about the ordering of outlining and inlining
- Make sure abstract methods don't override concrete methods

- Think about how Buffer[T] works
	- Take the generic vptr from the self fatptr to get the size_in_bytes
- Implement generic buffer operations

- Magic buffer methods
	- store_in_buffer and create_from_buffer just need that size_in_bytes to work
	- Store generic fields as boxed
	- Just use unboxed for actually storing in buffer
	- assignments with T in rhs would codegen directly to store_in_buffer

- Inheriting from an instantiated generic might require storing that type parameter at runtime
	- We could instead store it in the vtable or modify the stored subtype functions
	- Modifying the subtype function may be the most reasonable way to do it

- Allow multiple type checks in one condition
- Tighten up return type inference for function literals
	- You can't have a bare return and a return value in the same literal
	- Should we disallow all return statements in literals?
- Add tuple destructuring
- Check for mismatched yield types
- Allow capturing class methods
	- Will introduce A.b syntax
	- A.b will also denote module-qualified names
- Shift Functions and Coroutines to FatPtr interface
	- Store the fptr in the second word
- Don't unnecessarily duplicate behaviors
- Cast literals when passing as arguments
- Narrow alternate path in branches
	- The main motivation is to be able to pare off nil with "while x is Nil { yield(Exception); }"
	- If the condition of a while is a type check then that type can be pared off after the loop
	- We know that some intersections are uninhabitable (especially with nil)
	- Therefore we know that 'if x is Nil' implies that it is non-nil in the other branch
	- We know the intersection of a union with a negation of one of its members
- Make sure that c3 linearization interacts properly with imports
- Implement integer-float binary operations
- When call is statically known, narrow result types
	- Casting is needed (from behavior return type to narrowed return type)
	- If the intersection of the argument/parameter types is uninhabitable, that overload is ruled out
- Skip behavior call when all arguments are builtin types
- Both coroutines and funcs should inherit Callable[-T, +U]
- Actually free coroutine stacks
- Rewrite in PDL!
	- Block / region transformation needs to happen prior
	- Then textual substitution can happen after

# --- Known Bugs ---

- There's a bug in lowering early returns in else clauses [fixed!]
- Casting to/from Object in unions is not correct [fixed!]
- .all() is clearly not correct [fixed!]
- Declaring a variable without assigning to it is buggy [fixed!]
- Must distinguish union and tuple types in lowering [fixed!]
- Union sizing may not be technically correct for tuples because of padding
- Blocked matmul always fails
- If I compile with -O0 it hangs

# --- Problems ---

- Think about how multiple dispatch works with function types
	- Or more generally, how inheritance order precedence applies to type parameters
	- For Pair[+T, +U], which of Pair[Fish, Crocodile], and Pair[Shark, Reptile] is more specific for Pair[Shark, Crocodile] ?
	- We could go based on textual order, making Pair[Shark, Reptile] more specific
	- This would in principle allow (and incentivize) people to be intentional about the ordering of generic parameters
	- A function needs to store its type parameters
- The central idea is that within a confusable set, there exists a natural ordering of types
- If any two types in a confusable set have incompatible inheritence orders, then there is no order
- Rather than saying two methods are confusable if, for each pair of parameters, there exists a common subtype, we ought to say
	- That two methods are confusable if it not *illegal* for there to be a common subtype for each pair of parameters
- Currently, if an argument is passed which is a subtype of multiple parameter types, the dispatch will be arbitrary
- We will need to be able to perform runtime subtype checks of parameterized types
- This subtype test will be stored in the parameterized type's vtable
- The subtype test will probably take a parameter for the number of type parameters
- GLB with intersection types
	- GLB includes two intersections of each pair (of classes) in the set of types for the parameter
	- These intersections can be split into overlapping subsets representing different consistent hierarchies
	- Intersections not in the same subset are guaranteed to be mutually exclusive possibilities
	- Mutually exclusive possibilities can be checked consecutively with early exit
	- Intersections within a subset agree on the precedence of the types, and can be checked consecutively with early exit
	- Type narrowing implies that there will be variables whose static type is an intersection
- Runtime subtyping tests for unions in overload
	- We may actually want to disallow unions in parameter types
	- This is because a union multiply inherits without specifying its inheritance order
	- Alternatively, we can treat the textual order of the union as semantically relevant
- Delegation
	- We could pass TWO self pointers into all methods [check!]
	- Need to provide a named field for each delegatee
	- Normal initialization rules will apply
	- Need to synthesize forwarding methods which use open recursion
	- Should not inherit init method from delegates
	- Field accesses do not use open recursion because fields cannot be overridden
	- Allow only a single reference-type delegate
		- This would ensure that there is no duplication of fields
		- Still allows for multiple Struct delegates
		- This seems reasonable-- a struct delegate is basically just inheritance with preconstruction
		- Is there any reason to be able to refer to a struct delegate directly?
		- Just seems like a hack to not have to override constructors
		- Also we can't actually not inherit init methods for delegates
	- Alternatively, disallow multiple delegates with conflicting fields
		- There are still issues with methods
		- Could disallow all ambiguity between delegates
- Constructors
	- There's the Self.new() design choice to work with
	- T.alloc could return Uninitialized[T], which has one method, init
	- Uninitialized[T].init() -> T
	- Uninitialized would need to be a builtin type that forwards .init() calls

# --- Possibilities ---

- Inheriting from Sentinel (or do Struct types solve this)
- Bare 'yield();' should yield the coroutine itself?
- Specifying that a class cannot be inherited alongside another class
- Recursive aliases?
- Overloading *functions*
- Propagate type information backwards?
- Switch statements?
- Enums?
- Enable copying of coroutines
	- Would have to copy the whole stack
	- Would also have to know the actual stack size
	- Which, if we stored the top of the stack in the coroutine, would be easy

# --- later on ---

- FFI
- Struct Types
	- How much would struct types actually entail?
	- virtual calls resolve to static calls
	- allocated on stack
	- value semantics
	- subtype test is vptr equality
	- this seems fairly straightforward?
	- Except that value semantics for self is immensely complicated
	- How to pass self to virtual calls requires change
	- Basically requires generating a struct version of the class
- Regions
- Generics
	- Store type T as implicit member, use to construct instances of T
	- No monomorphization
	- Implicit conversion to type constraint (by default Object)
	- Small buffer optimization for small struct types
	- Variadic generics
	- Roadmap
		- start with simplistic runtime subtype checks
		- migrate builtin generic types to uniform interface
		- start with invariance for subtyping
		- start by implementing the magic buffer methods for existing types
		- what's important is that these methods are available in the vtable
		- Maybe I should start by making everything a subtype of Object
- Multithreading
	- Can't use RAII for scoped mutexes
	- But manually locked and unlocked mutexes are fine

class Uninitialized[T] {
	@allocated : T
	def init() -> T {
		@allocated.init();
	}
}

class Object {
	def Self.from_data_buffer(buf : Buffer[i8], start_index : i32) -> Self {
		return magic_from_data_buffer(buf, start_index, Self.size_in_bytes());
	}
	def Self.size_in_bytes() -> i32 {
		return magic_size_in_bytes(self);
	}
	def place_in_buffer(buffer : Buffer[i8], start_index : i32) {
		magic_place_into_buffer(self, buffer, start_index);
	}
}

class Array[T] {

	@buffer : Buffer[T]
	@size : i32
	@capacity : i32

	@T : Type	// implicit type member

	def init[T] (@buffer : Buffer[T], @size : i32, @capacity : i32) {
		// @T implicitly initialized with [T]
	}
	def [](i : i32) -> T {
		return T.from_data_buffer(@buffer, T.size_in_bytes() * i);
	}
}

consider a signature that takes a function of type f : Function[i32, Animal]
since functions are covariant in return type and contravariant in argument type, a function of type Function[i32, Shark] should be able to be passed in
can the offset be appropriately set?
it may actually be more correct when the type parameter is passed in by the call and not at instantiation
or at least the type parameter has to be updated upon upcast
in which case is there even any difference?
	- cost of upcast
	- storage cost of extra member
	- indirection cost of obtaining type member
	- there's more to this...

the offset cannot be known statically unless it is carried as a member
