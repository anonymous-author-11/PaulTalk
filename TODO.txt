TODO:

- Generic buffer size and indexing
	- First just change bufferindexationop to take a dynamic type size [check!]
	- Change createbuffer to take dynamic size as well [check!]
	- For buffer creation we will need to get type size from ambient parameterizations
	- Retrieve parameterization and use its size_fn for creation and indexation
	- Need to modify create, buffer_get, and buffer_set concurrently
- Generic tuple creation and indexing
- Add file name to error messages
- Make intrinsics better
- Make sure abstract methods don't override concrete methods
- Add asserts
	- There's mlir functionality (cf.assert) for this
	- Compile to llvm.assume in release; branch to abort in debug
- Add assumes for unions of builtins?
	- vptr must be equal to one of a set of possible
- Figure out why I had to split Entry constructor into two and if it can be fixed
- Maybe create offset & hash table separately and just give names to typedef
	- Question is whether they need passed-through information
	- If they do, split them off; otherwise, keep bundled
	- Then only have to pass getter, box, and subtype fn names to typeptrs
- Polymorphic construction could just be conservatively aliased
	- i.e. T.new(a, b, c)
	- Very interesting idea
- I really want to get generics fully working first
	- Would really like for fields to be specialized size [check!]
	- Will make field offsets more complicated [check!]
	- On instance creation, store a mapping from formal offsets to real offsets
	- Or even just store the sizes of the unbaked types
	- 8 bits per size, add to invariant section
- Calloc will zero freshly allocated memory
- Implement user-exposed getters
	- Shouldn't be technically difficult
	- Will significantly improve ergonomics
	- Especially now with lifetime annotations
	- May actually technically be more efficient
	- Not needing to cast self twice
- Will need to apply class region constraints upon downcast
	- Do we actually?
	- What about automatic downcast upon multi-dispatch?
- Conservatively alias parameters for first-class functions

- Implement more precise lifetimes for tuples
	- Use .1, .2, .3 pseudo-fields
- Make sure regions and fields don't have conflicting names
- Minimize number of behaviors
	- Do we really need to generate all-new behaviors for every new subclass?
	- Why not just new behaviors for the ones that have actually changed?
	- Will make vtables significantly smaller
- Implement Records
	- Should actually be relatively straightforward
	- Record-to-tuple is also straightforward
- Reduce number of redundant type fields
- Do less work for imports
	- Make .lib archives of .bc files and --link-only-needed
	- Decrease work done in interface_codegen
	- Type-check specific imports on-demand rather than upfront
- Clean up compilation of files with no main() or no specified outfile
- Think about initialization of buffers and nil checks
- Think about how actually to handle union type parameters
- Implement type parameter deduction from init()
- Make sure that type bounds are applied generally
	- What does this mean?
- Where clauses for method type parameters
- Figure out signature compatibility of overrides of generic parameters
- Figure out a way to get methods into builtin vtables
	- Define intrinsics for operations on boxed interfaces
	- PrimitiveDef subtype of ClassDef?
- Shift array and range literals to new generics
	- Will need to do buffer optimization first for array
	- And to do buffer optimization we need stored type parameters
	- Which we do now have
- Magic buffer methods
	- store_in_buffer and create_from_buffer just need that size_in_bytes to work
	- Store generic fields as boxed
	- Just use unboxed for actually storing in buffer
	- assignments with T in rhs would codegen directly to store_in_buffer

- Allow multiple type checks in one condition
- Tighten up return type inference for function literals
	- You can't have a bare return and a return value in the same literal
	- Should we disallow all return statements in literals?
- Add tuple destructuring
- Check for mismatched yield types
- Allow capturing class methods
	- Will introduce A.b syntax
	- A.b will also denote module-qualified names
- Shift Functions and Coroutines to FatPtr interface
	- Store the fptr in the second word
- Don't unnecessarily duplicate behaviors
- Cast literals when passing as arguments
- Narrow alternate path in branches
	- The main motivation is to be able to pare off nil with "while x is Nil { yield(Exception); }"
	- If the condition of a while is a type check then that type can be pared off after the loop
	- We know that some intersections are uninhabitable (especially with nil)
	- Therefore we know that 'if x is Nil' implies that it is non-nil in the other branch
	- We know the intersection of a union with a negation of one of its members
- Make sure that c3 linearization interacts properly with imports
- Implement integer-float binary operations
- When call is statically known, narrow result types
	- Casting is needed (from behavior return type to narrowed return type)
	- If the intersection of the argument/parameter types is uninhabitable, that overload is ruled out
- Skip behavior call when all arguments are builtin types
- Both coroutines and funcs should inherit Callable[-T, +U]
- Actually free coroutine stacks
- Rewrite in PDL!
	- Block / region transformation needs to happen prior
	- Then textual substitution can happen after

# --- Known Bugs ---

- Interface codegenning a method may create a signature mismatch with the original due to different behavior signatures
- There's a bug in lowering early returns in else clauses [fixed!]
- Casting to/from Object in unions is not correct [fixed!]
- .all() is clearly not correct [fixed!]
- Declaring a variable without assigning to it is buggy [fixed!]
- Must distinguish union and tuple types in lowering [fixed!]
- Union sizing may not be technically correct for tuples because of padding
- Blocked matmul always fails
- If I compile with -O0 it hangs
	- Seems to be related to loading fatptr as { ptr, i160 }
	- Plausibly related to type legalization in llc
	- I believe it is that i128 and above is supposed to be 16-bit aligned
	- So I should move TypeParameter and union to something like { ptr, [20 x i8] }
	- Or maybe use something janky like {ptr, i64, i64, ... (however many) ..., i[rest] }

# --- Problems ---

- Think about how multiple dispatch works with function types
	- Or more generally, how inheritance order precedence applies to type parameters
	- For Pair[+T, +U], which of Pair[Fish, Crocodile], and Pair[Shark, Reptile] is more specific for Pair[Shark, Crocodile] ?
	- We could go based on textual order, making Pair[Shark, Reptile] more specific
	- This would in principle allow (and incentivize) people to be intentional about the ordering of generic parameters
	- A function needs to store its type parameters
- The central idea is that within a confusable set, there exists a natural ordering of types
- If any two types in a confusable set have incompatible inheritence orders, then there is no order
- Rather than saying two methods are confusable if, for each pair of parameters, there exists a common subtype, we ought to say
	- That two methods are confusable if it not *illegal* for there to be a common subtype for each pair of parameters
- Currently, if an argument is passed which is a subtype of multiple parameter types, the dispatch will be arbitrary
- We will need to be able to perform runtime subtype checks of parameterized types
- This subtype test will be stored in the parameterized type's vtable
- The subtype test will probably take a parameter for the number of type parameters
- GLB with intersection types
	- GLB includes two intersections of each pair (of classes) in the set of types for the parameter
	- These intersections can be split into overlapping subsets representing different consistent hierarchies
	- Intersections not in the same subset are guaranteed to be mutually exclusive possibilities
	- Mutually exclusive possibilities can be checked consecutively with early exit
	- Intersections within a subset agree on the precedence of the types, and can be checked consecutively with early exit
	- Type narrowing implies that there will be variables whose static type is an intersection
- Runtime subtyping tests for unions in overload
	- We may actually want to disallow unions in parameter types
	- This is because a union multiply inherits without specifying its inheritance order
	- Alternatively, we can treat the textual order of the union as semantically relevant
- Delegation
	- We could pass TWO self pointers into all methods [check!]
	- Need to provide a named field for each delegatee
	- Normal initialization rules will apply
	- Need to synthesize forwarding methods which use open recursion
	- Should not inherit init method from delegates
	- Field accesses do not use open recursion because fields cannot be overridden
	- Allow only a single reference-type delegate
		- This would ensure that there is no duplication of fields
		- Still allows for multiple Struct delegates
		- This seems reasonable-- a struct delegate is basically just inheritance with preconstruction
		- Is there any reason to be able to refer to a struct delegate directly?
		- Just seems like a hack to not have to override constructors
		- Also we can't actually not inherit init methods for delegates
	- Alternatively, disallow multiple delegates with conflicting fields
		- There are still issues with methods
		- Could disallow all ambiguity between delegates
- Constructors
	- There's the Self.new() design choice to work with
	- T.alloc could return Uninitialized[T], which has one method, init
	- Uninitialized[T].init() -> T
	- Uninitialized would need to be a builtin type that forwards .init() calls

# --- Possibilities ---

- Assume call return value offsets
- Expect reciever static types

- You could inline context switches by breaking functions into sections upon yields and calls
	- Would require significant ingenuity but would secure your glory forever
	- Would significantly improve optimizations across context switches
	- Would need to manually maintain live variables across yields and calls
	- Maybe the outlined call would have some prelude retrieving old variables?
	- Probably best to leverage LLVM coroutine tech for tracking live variables
- Freelist of coroutine stacks?
	- Ring buffer LIFO stack
	- Fixed capacity
	- Much faster than VirtualAlloc
- Memory regions
	- Abstract memory regions (oh boy I'm cookin)
		- Abstract associated regions (oh god!)
			- Abstract bounded polymorphic associated regions (god mode)
	- Will probably need to store ptrs to virtual regions in fields
		- Wait, why? Do we actually?
	- Unclear if boxed types will need to carry regions

- Manual memory management combines four questions
	- When memory gets allocated and deallocated
	- Where objects are stored in memory
		- Which objects are near each other
	- How objects are stored in memory
		- How they are laid out
	- Semiautomatic memory management removes some of these choices from the programmer
		- You decide how objects are laid out, and can impose some constraints on where
		- The compiler decides when memory is allocated and deallocated

- Inheriting from Sentinel (or do Struct types solve this)
- Bare 'yield();' should yield the coroutine itself?
- Specifying that a class cannot be inherited alongside another class
- Recursive aliases?
- Overloading *functions*
	- Making all toplevel functions methods of a file-wide class?
- Propagate type information backwards?
	- Probably just in certain easy circumstances
- Enable copying of coroutines
	- Would have to copy the whole stack
	- Would also have to know the actual stack size
	- Which, if we stored the top of the stack in the coroutine, would be easy

# --- later on ---

- FFI
- Struct Types
	- How much would struct types actually entail?
	- virtual calls resolve to static calls
	- allocated on stack
	- value semantics
	- subtype test is vptr equality
	- this seems fairly straightforward?
	- Except that value semantics for self is immensely complicated
	- How to pass self to virtual calls requires change
	- Basically requires generating a struct version of the class
	- Unclear how methods will even work
		- When self is passed as variable, it is copied
		- When self is passed as receiver, it is by ref
		- Would have to box self whenever passed as variable
	- Must be boxed to be used in place of ref version?
- Regions
- Generics
	- Store type T as implicit member, use to construct instances of T
	- No monomorphization
	- Implicit conversion to type constraint (by default Any)
	- Small buffer optimization for small struct types
	- Variadic generics
	- Roadmap
		- start with simplistic runtime subtype checks
		- migrate builtin generic types to uniform interface
		- start with invariance for subtyping
		- start by implementing the magic buffer methods for existing types
		- what's important is that these methods are available in the vtable
		- Maybe I should start by making everything a subtype of Object
- Multithreading
	- Can't use RAII for scoped mutexes
	- But manually locked and unlocked mutexes are fine

class Uninitialized[T] {
	@allocated : T
	def init() -> T {
		@allocated.init();
	}
}

class Object {
	def Self.from_data_buffer(buf : Buffer[i8], start_index : i32) -> Self {
		return magic_from_data_buffer(buf, start_index, Self.size_in_bytes());
	}
	def Self.size_in_bytes() -> i32 {
		return magic_size_in_bytes(self);
	}
	def place_in_buffer(buffer : Buffer[i8], start_index : i32) {
		magic_place_into_buffer(self, buffer, start_index);
	}
}

class Array[T] {

	@buffer : Buffer[T]
	@size : i32
	@capacity : i32

	@T : Type	// implicit type member

	def init[T] (@buffer : Buffer[T], @size : i32, @capacity : i32) {
		// @T implicitly initialized with [T]
	}
	def [](i : i32) -> T {
		return T.from_data_buffer(@buffer, T.size_in_bytes() * i);
	}
}

consider a signature that takes a function of type f : Function[i32, Animal]
since functions are covariant in return type and contravariant in argument type, a function of type Function[i32, Shark] should be able to be passed in
can the offset be appropriately set?
it may actually be more correct when the type parameter is passed in by the call and not at instantiation
or at least the type parameter has to be updated upon upcast
in which case is there even any difference?
	- cost of upcast
	- storage cost of extra member
	- indirection cost of obtaining type member
	- there's more to this...

the offset cannot be known statically unless it is carried as a member
